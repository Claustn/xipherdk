      <description>If you have been using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit ) toolkit from Microsoft you probably have had to need to add custom application, one of the main &amp;ldquo;culprits&amp;rdquo; is Flash Player with its ever changing name (filename contains it&amp;rsquo;s version number)</description>

      <description>I thought I had posted this script more than a year ago, but apparently I have not. It is quite similar to the script, I posted recently sending SMS messages through unwire, this just allows bibob customers to send messages through bibobs online gateway.</description>

      <description>At work we have bought an SMS gateway service through the danish company Unwire, so after we the deal was signed we got the information on how to send email through their services, so in order to test I wrote a quick Powershell script to test it.</description>

      <description>There was a post on the Minasi forum, where someone was trying to check which users had start/stop permissions on a given server. I knew SC would give the results, but it returns it in DACL format, which as far from readable by humans&amp;hellip; So since I had some time to pass I decided to try to write a powershell script to translate the DACL into something human readable (We were having our floor lacquered, and the guy doing it, had a little extra lacquer, and decided to lacquer our hallway, thereby cutting me off from leaving the first floor of our house).</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my admin account kept getting locked out, after I had changed my password.. So I assumed I had used it somewhere to either run a service or a scheduled task on a test server.</description>

      <description>A while back I posted a script that would take whatever input it got, into a sortable HTML table in a file.
Last night my family was here, and they wanted to see the Eurovision song contest thing, so I had some time to rewrite the script into a PowerShell V2 Advanced function, that supports pipeline input.</description>

      <description>Seems as if Quest has been doing some really cool things with Powershell, from what I can read, they have &amp;ldquo;rolled&amp;rdquo; it up as a webservice, meaning that you can now run your Powershell scripts over HTTPS from either you local machine, your phone, anything that supports a newer web browser.</description>
