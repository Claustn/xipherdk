      <description>I just got my new TomTom 930T GPS, I unpacked it and connected it to my phone via Bluetooth, it asked me if I wanted to connect to &amp;ldquo;internet&amp;rdquo; and of course I had to try it, it asked me which country I was in, then which phone I had, my Nokia E65 was in the list, then which telco I used&amp;hellip; But to my luck mine was not in the list, I know my carrier Bibob uses Sonofon network, so I decided to try choosing that from the menu.</description>
