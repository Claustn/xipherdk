      <description>There was a post on the Minasi forum, where someone was trying to check which users had start/stop permissions on a given server. I knew SC would give the results, but it returns it in DACL format, which as far from readable by humans&amp;hellip; So since I had some time to pass I decided to try to write a powershell script to translate the DACL into something human readable (We were having our floor lacquered, and the guy doing it, had a little extra lacquer, and decided to lacquer our hallway, thereby cutting me off from leaving the first floor of our house).</description>
