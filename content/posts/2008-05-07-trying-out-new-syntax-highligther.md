title: Trying out new Syntax Highligther
---
I am testing a new Syntax Highlighter to make made code posts look better...

The new one looks really good, and has some nice features like "copy to clipboard" and "view plain", but unfortunately it does not support PowerShell...

So if you see my code snippets change appearance, you now know why :)
