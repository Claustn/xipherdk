title: Output a sortable HTML table
---
A while back I posted a script that would take whatever input it got, into a sortable HTML table in a file.

Last night my family was here, and they wanted to see the Eurovision song contest thing, so I had some time to rewrite the script into a PowerShell V2 Advanced function, that supports pipeline input.

There are some examples in the code on how to use the function

I do not know what has happened to code highlighter, but it has suddenly decided to mess up the code, so it is not working on the site, so here is a link to the file.

Example of output:
