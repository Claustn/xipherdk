title: Test Flash Drive
---
I recently tried a software package called MojoPac.&nbsp; During the install of MojoPac to my USB stick it complained that it might not work very well, because it detected that I had a slow USB stick... So I started wondering, what do I need to test the speed of my USB drives, besides some large files and a&nbsp;stopwatch.

I did some quick googeling and found a nice little utility called&nbsp; Chkflsh, which can be downloaded [Here](http://mikelab.kiev.ua/PROGRAMS/ChkFlsh.zip)

It is a very nice little tool, that allows you to check the speed of the drive, and make sure all areas of memory works as it should.

I have just gotten an 8GB Kingston DataTraveler, which I am currently testing.... I am getting Read speed around 16MB/s and Write Speeds averaging just above 10MB/s. Pretty decent speed compared to price, it costs around 170Kr (35USD)
