This is going to be a short post, I fractured at least one bone in my hand playing basketball the other night, after sitting 6 hours in the emergency room until 4.30 in the morning, they decided that since at least one bone was fractured both vertically and horisontally I would need a cast. So the next 3 weeks it is back to the one handed 4 finger system. \*sigh\*
