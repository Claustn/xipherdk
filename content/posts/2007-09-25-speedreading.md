Just a little thing, that I have never thought of before...  
When you learn to write, you learn that the letters should "on" the line, meaning that when you write, your focus is on the lower half of the letters, to make sure they are on the line. And that rubs off on your reading as well, most people have a tendency to place a book at a 90 degree angle or more when the read... Which is optimal if you want to focus on the lower half of the letters. But studies have shown that with the Latin alphabet, it is much easier to discern the letters by looking at the top half of the letters.  
Here is a little test, it is two lines from two different posts made by Nathan, which one is easier to read ?
