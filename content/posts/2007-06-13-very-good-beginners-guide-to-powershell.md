title: Very good beginners guide to PowerShell
---
I recently stumbled&nbsp;upon this little e-book about PowerShell, I have'nt read it from end to end yet, but from what I have read so far, it seems very good... So if you are interested in starting to learn some PowerShell this is a good place to start.
