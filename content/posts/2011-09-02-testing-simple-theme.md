I am currently having some problems with my site, apparently it gets linked to be a lot of spam sites, resulting in more than 4000 visits in the last 24 hours. These "visitors" have generated over 1GB worth of traffic, and there is a 10GB cap on my current account.. So that this rate my site will be closed in 10 days :(
