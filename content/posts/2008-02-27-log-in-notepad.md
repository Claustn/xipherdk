title: .LOG in notepad
---
I was recently made aware of a feature in notepad that I was not aware of.

If you open Notepad and type in .LOG (In CAPITAL letters) and the save it.

Then when you open the .txt file next time it will automatically append the date to the end of the file.

Very nice if you want to manually log data to a file.. For instance changes on a server.
