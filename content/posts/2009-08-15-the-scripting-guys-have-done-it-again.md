They have gone back and tagged all the scripts they have made during the last many years, and put up an easily searchable repository on their site on Technet.

They are calling it the [Script Gallery](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/en-us/)

You can sort scripts now by:  
o Category  
o Affiliation (Microsoft or community)  
o Script language  
o Supported platforms  
o Tags
