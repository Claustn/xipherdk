title: Tickets booked and I am ready to go!
---
Finally everything should be in place now, I have booked the plane tickets to Dulles Airport in Washington, I supposedly have a Cadillac waiting for me on arrival.

I am planning to spend the first 1Â½ day in the Washington area, to see the sights.. I am probably going to meet up with a guy called Dennis from Canada and his wife. Then we are going to drive down to Virgina Beach, for the 2008 forummeet. Then spending 5 days in VA, before I drive back up to Washington and fly back home.

&nbsp;

Cant wait until the 18th...
