title: Been a little slow lately  ;)
---
It has been a little slow here for a while, between being very busy at work, and then starting a new job, I haven't had enough time to blog that much. But hopefully that will change... I have started working more with Azure, so as always I usually tend to learn better myself when writing stuff down.. So I will have a series of posts regarding PowerShell and Azure, initially it will probably be some getting started stuff, which I hope will be usefull (I know it will be for me, so that is the most important thing :) )

Stay tuned
