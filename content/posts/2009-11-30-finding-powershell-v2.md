title: Finding Powershell V2
---
Joel Bennet made a good point about it can be difficult to find Powershell V2 on the MS site. I am not going to rewrite Joels post, so I will just "quote" it.

> For some reason, people are having trouble finding links to the release version of Windows PowerShell 2.0 … I suspect it’s because while it was in CTP, a lot of us bloggers wrote about it and linked to the various CTP downloads … but there aren’t nearly as many posts announcing the release of Windows PowerShell 2.0 as you would expect.
> 
> Of course, most of the fault is Microsoft’s, because they buried PowerShell 2 in a knowledge base article with a title that exceeds nondescript, even for Microsoft: Description of the Windows Management Framework on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. What? Even the Microsoft PowerShell Team Blog never actually wrote a post announcing the PowerShell 2.0 release is available for download but instead wrote about the Windows Management Framework being released.
> 
> But in any case, I’m calling on the blogging community to fix the search engines by linking Windows PowerShell and particularly “Windows PowerShell 2.0”: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929 to either the Knowledge base article 968929 which has the download links for PowerShell 2.0 for Windows XP, Vista, and Server 2003 and 2008 … or to Microsoft.com/PowerShell which has the latest download links in the side-column on the right hand side. :)

> I can’t fix the search engines on my own, but what was that slogan? Together we can!
