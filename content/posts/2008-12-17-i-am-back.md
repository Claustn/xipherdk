Have you missed me ??

I know I have been away for a while, but between becoming a dad, starting a new job, having to get deep knowledge of several different enterprise products that I have not worked with before has taken some time... But now things are looking a little less hectic, so I hope to get some good PowerShell posts written up in the near future.

In the very near future I will also write a post about the Minasi 2009 conference, that we are trying to put together for April 2009, there will be some exciting speakers lined up, but more to come one that soon.
